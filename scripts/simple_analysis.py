# The fix script should:
1. Get all events from database
2. Get all fights from database  
3. Create mapping of event names to event IDs
4. Create mapping of fight names to correct events
5. Update each fight's event_id to the correct event
6. Verify the changes

# Example mapping:
event_fight_mapping = {
    "UFC 300: Pereira vs Hill": [
        "Alex Pereira vs Jamahal Hill",
        "Zhang Weili vs Yan Xiaonan",
